# eecs448_project2
This  branch has the most up to date code for our EECS 448 Memory Game 

The authors of this code are: Amy, Jacob, Katherine, Keith, Linda, and Megan

This project addressed the issue of creating an application and building a prototpe 

This project is coding in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS 

The Memory game has multiple levels, as the level increase the amount of cards that must be matched increases as well. There is a counter that tracks the amount of moves it takes to complete the level. You can also go back to previous levels, restart the game, and move on to levels at any point in time. In the game you will be matching random cards from a deck of cards.
